# nsa-codebreaker-2021

I completed the entire NSA Codebreaker 2021 challenge.

Here are some Rust scripts I wrote to help me complete the challenge.

Unfortunately, I didnt take thorough notes so I do not have a nice writeup that documents how I solved all 10 tasks.

Searching Github, I found a pretty good [writeup](https://github.com/luker983/nsa-codebreaker-2021) if you are interested in learning the details of the challenge.

I am sharing my code because I think its a bit cool as I was able to crack their encryption (task 8), reverse engineer the remote server protocol (task 9), steal the server private key and exploit the server's http service with a ROP chain binary exploit to leak sensitive data (task 10).
